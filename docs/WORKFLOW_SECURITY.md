# Workflow Security

## Overview

This document describes the security measures implemented in the GitHub Actions workflows for this repository, particularly focusing on the PR validation workflow (`.github/workflows/pr.yaml`).

## Security Architecture

### 1. Workflow YAML Protection

**Mechanism**: `pull_request_target` trigger

The PR workflow uses `pull_request_target` instead of `pull_request`. This means:
- The workflow YAML file is always executed from the base branch (main)
- Pull requests cannot modify the workflow logic that validates them
- Prevents malicious PRs from weakening or bypassing validation checks

**Code Reference**:
```yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:  # Runs from the main branch, not from PR branch
    branches:
      - main
```

### 2. Configuration File Protection

**Problem**: While `pull_request_target` protects the workflow YAML, the checked-out code includes configuration files (`.editorconfig`, `BannedSymbols.txt`, etc.) that control:
- Code analyzer behavior
- Code quality standards
- Security scanning rules

A malicious PR could modify these files to disable security checks.

**Solution**: After checking out the PR code, we fetch and overwrite configuration files from the trusted main branch.

**Protected Configuration Files**:
- `.editorconfig` - Code style and analyzer rules
- `Directory.Build.props` - MSBuild properties
- `Directory.Build.targets` - MSBuild targets
- `BannedSymbols.txt` - Banned API usage rules
- `*.globalconfig` - Global analyzer configuration
- `*.ruleset` - Code analysis rulesets

**Implementation** (added to all workflow jobs):
```yaml
- name: Fetch trusted configuration files from main branch
  run: |
    echo "Fetching configuration files from main branch to prevent malicious overrides..."
    
    # Fetch the main branch
    git fetch origin main:main-branch
    
    # List of configuration files that should come from trusted main branch
    config_files=(
      ".editorconfig"
      "Directory.Build.props"
      "Directory.Build.targets"
      "BannedSymbols.txt"
      "*.globalconfig"
      "*.ruleset"
    )
    
    # Copy each configuration file from main branch if it exists
    for config_file in "${config_files[@]}"; do
      # [Copy logic - see workflow file for full implementation]
    done
```

### 3. Credential Protection

**Mechanism**: `persist-credentials: false`

All checkout steps include `persist-credentials: false` to prevent the checkout token from being written to git config:

```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    ref: refs/pull/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/head
    persist-credentials: false
```

**Note**: This prevents the token from being stored in git config, but does NOT prevent steps from accessing `GITHUB_TOKEN` if explicitly exposed.

### 4. Minimal Permissions

The workflow runs with minimal required permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

This limits the impact if the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is somehow exposed or misused.

## Attack Scenarios Prevented

### Scenario 1: Malicious Workflow Modification
**Attack**: PR modifies `.github/workflows/pr.yaml` to disable security checks
**Prevention**: `pull_request_target` ensures workflow runs from main branch
**Status**: ✅ Protected

### Scenario 2: Configuration File Tampering
**Attack**: PR modifies `.editorconfig` to disable security analyzers
**Prevention**: Configuration files are fetched from main branch after checkout
**Status**: ✅ Protected (as of this PR)

### Scenario 3: Credential Theft
**Attack**: PR contains malicious code that tries to access GitHub credentials
**Prevention**: `persist-credentials: false` + minimal permissions
**Status**: ✅ Protected

### Scenario 4: Code Analysis Bypass
**Attack**: PR modifies `BannedSymbols.txt` or `.ruleset` to allow dangerous APIs
**Prevention**: These files are fetched from main branch after checkout
**Status**: ✅ Protected (as of this PR)

## Testing

Security tests have been created and validated:

1. **Configuration Fetch Test**: Verifies that configuration files can be successfully fetched from the main branch
2. **Malicious Modification Test**: Simulates a PR that modifies `.editorconfig` to disable analyzers and confirms it's replaced with the trusted version

Both tests pass successfully.

## Maintenance

When adding new configuration files that control code quality or security:

1. Add the file name to the `config_files` array in all workflow jobs
2. Test that the file is correctly fetched from main branch
3. Update this documentation
